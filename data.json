The tools to deactivate the profile was removed 3 version of Mac OS ago and changing the selected microphone in the settings does nothing.<p>As they don't suffer from the same problem, I am looking for dongle-based over ear headphones like the Logitech G 735. In order criteria are: \"works with mac os\", over the ear,  comfortable, good audio, ANC, low latency, mic optional but a nice microphone a plus.<p>After endless frustrating google searches it seems only Logitech advertise Mac OS support on some of their headphones. Most tests or reviews don't mention mac os, and I think most of the dongle based headphones that \"support\" mac os is through the Bluetooth, which is a no-go for my use case.<p>- G735 work, sound OK but they feel a bit heavy and basically no noise isolation (also not inexpensive).\n- G733 should work with Mac OS, be lighter than G 735, but worse sound, isolation and latency (at least they seem relatively inexpensive)\n- G533 also should work, be light as well, but same problems and worse sound, isolation and latency (also available relatively inexpensive)\n- G Pro X2: should sound better, but Mac OS status is unknown<p>Anybody has good Mac OS experience with the above headphones or the Razer BlackShark series (the last one has ANC) ? Or able to recommend another pair?<p>1: https://support.apple.com/en-us/102217 :\n\"If sound quality is reduced when using Bluetooth headphones with your Mac Quit any apps that use your Bluetooth headphones' built-in microphone, then try your audio again.\" : unfortunately I can't quit AWS Workspace.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45286822\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45286822</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "desc": "<p>Hello,<p>I got an idea from a friend a couple of weeks ago when we were discussing how heavy simple apps have become with all their unnecessary features. If you only want to communicate via good old text, you almost certainly need to install some kind of heavy and often slow desktop app. We talked about how cool it would be to just use your terminal without any dependencies. So I got the idea to create a simple chat app, but instead of making YAA (yet another app), why not use something almost all people already have installed on their PCs - SSH? So TermChat was born.<p>Simply type: ssh termchat.me<p>then: /help to see all the available commands or /register and then /login.<p>Switch panes via tab, navigate by 'hjkl' or arrows.<p>It’s still early days, so there will be (are) bugs and hiccups but the basics work: public/private rooms, notifications, and DMs.<p>There are no email registration/verification etc. It's simple username/password registration. Passwords are hashed and salted, private rooms and chats are encrypted at rest.<p>I'm working with code cleanup and docs. now and planning to open source it soon.<p>Feedback, critique or anything that could help me improve this project are welcome.
