The tools to deactivate the profile was removed 3 version of Mac OS ago and changing the selected microphone in the settings does nothing.<p>As they don't suffer from the same problem, I am looking for dongle-based over ear headphones like the Logitech G 735. In order criteria are: \"works with mac os\", over the ear,  comfortable, good audio, ANC, low latency, mic optional but a nice microphone a plus.<p>After endless frustrating google searches it seems only Logitech advertise Mac OS support on some of their headphones. Most tests or reviews don't mention mac os, and I think most of the dongle based headphones that \"support\" mac os is through the Bluetooth, which is a no-go for my use case.<p>- G735 work, sound OK but they feel a bit heavy and basically no noise isolation (also not inexpensive).\n- G733 should work with Mac OS, be lighter than G 735, but worse sound, isolation and latency (at least they seem relatively inexpensive)\n- G533 also should work, be light as well, but same problems and worse sound, isolation and latency (also available relatively inexpensive)\n- G Pro X2: should sound better, but Mac OS status is unknown<p>Anybody has good Mac OS experience with the above headphones or the Razer BlackShark series (the last one has ANC) ? Or able to recommend another pair?<p>1: https://support.apple.com/en-us/102217 :\n\"If sound quality is reduced when using Bluetooth headphones with your Mac Quit any apps that use your Bluetooth headphones' built-in microphone, then try your audio again.\" : unfortunately I can't quit AWS Workspace.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45286822\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45286822</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "desc": "<p>Hello,<p>I got an idea from a friend a couple of weeks ago when we were discussing how heavy simple apps have become with all their unnecessary features. If you only want to communicate via good old text, you almost certainly need to install some kind of heavy and often slow desktop app. We talked about how cool it would be to just use your terminal without any dependencies. So I got the idea to create a simple chat app, but instead of making YAA (yet another app), why not use something almost all people already have installed on their PCs - SSH? So TermChat was born.<p>Simply type: ssh termchat.me<p>then: /help to see all the available commands or /register and then /login.<p>Switch panes via tab, navigate by 'hjkl' or arrows.<p>It’s still early days, so there will be (are) bugs and hiccups but the basics work: public/private rooms, notifications, and DMs.<p>There are no email registration/verification etc. It's simple username/password registration. Passwords are hashed and salted, private rooms and chats are encrypted at rest.<p>I'm working with code cleanup and docs. now and planning to open source it soon.<p>Feedback, critique or anything that could help me improve this project are welcome.

They all had limitations:\n- Only single face swaps\n- Poor video quality with flickering\n- No proper GIF support, especially for multiple faces\n- Clunky UX requiring multiple steps<p>So I built what I wished existed.<p>*Pricing model:*\n- Free trial to test it out\n- Daily free credits (casual users might never pay)\n- Pay-as-you-go for volume (no subscription)<p>*Tech challenges I solved:*\n- Face tracking across video frames\n- Handling occlusions (when faces turn away)\n- Multi-face detection and assignment in animated GIFs\n- GIF color palette preservation while swapping multiple faces<p>*Current limitations:*\n- Processing videos takes time (30s video = ~3-5 min processing)\n- Works best with clear, well-lit faces\n- Very fast motion can still cause artifacts<p>I'm a solo developer and spent 2 months getting the quality right. Would love feedback from HN:\n- What use cases would you have for this?\n- Is multi-face swapping something you've needed?\n- Any concerns about the technology?<p>Try it out – I think you'll find the quality noticeably better than alternatives.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45653516\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45653516</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

I'll have a write-up about technology soonish, but in short - this prototype written with Haskell, no database, everything server-side rendered, frontend with Unpoly (pulled from CDN), HTML generated manually. Deployed as Cloudflare container with single request taking approx. 0.8ms time.<p>Note: because it's using naive load balancing there might be some jank as containers wake up.<p>No data gathering whatsoever outside of requests and also some debug output from parser.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45709856\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45709856</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

It is not a journaling tool but it is simple and widely supported - GitHub, VSCode, etc and it eliminated a lot of the context switching that came with using dedicated note-taking apps.<p>What I would miss probably is the inline database, and other rich content which I have learned to stop using. But, I have optimized my journalling workflows to a lot of my prompting techniques. I use regular tables and split documents more deliberately. I reference them across journals when needed, kind of like having dedicated prompts for each part of a workflow.<p>I use the a lot of the prompting techniques in journalling as well - instead of creating inline database, I use the regular tables (more flattened and un-linked), and started splitting documents more, and referencing them in my journals.<p>I also sometimes put YAML frontmatter at the top for metadata and descriptions.

    "summary_en": "The author describes recent updates to ts-wolfram, including dropping OOP in favor of algebraic data types for cleaner code, enabling kernel/userspace interop to allow mixed definitions in expression evaluation, and improving printing functionality with shorthand support. While progress was made, further work is needed for better pretty printing.",
    "summary_zh": "作者介绍了ts-wolfram的最新更新，包括用代数数据类型代替OOP以简化代码，启用内核/用户空间互操作以允许在表达式评估中混合定义，以及改进了对简写的打印功能。尽管取得了进展，但仍需要进一步的工作以实现更好的美观打印。",
    "best_quote_en": "Once it works a little, it’s so much fun to keep adding functionality you end up working on it despite yourself.",
    "best_quote_zh": "一旦它开始工作，不断添加功能就变得非常有趣，以至于你会不由自主地继续开发它。"
